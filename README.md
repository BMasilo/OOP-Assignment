#Brief:

Create a class called Person which defines the generic data and functionality of a person. Now as we know there are a lot of things involved with a Person e.g (age,gender,their address, height, shoe size, passport number, etc). but in this case we are only interested in showing their name, age, gender, and interests, and we also want to be able to write a short introduction about them based on this data, and get them to say Hello. This is known as abstraction in OOP ,creating a simple model of a more complex thing, which represents its most important aspects in a way that is easy to work with for our program's purposes.
